# 🎄 Advent of Code - Python Solutions in Jupyter Notebooks
## Welcome to my repository of Advent of Code challenge solutions! 🎅✨

### This repository contains my daily challenge solutions, organized as Jupyter Notebooks and written in Python.

## 📚 About Advent of Code
### Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge calendar leading up to Christmas. Each day, a new problem is released, testing your skills in logic, algorithms, and programming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python: Main language for solving the challenges.
- Jupyter Notebook: Tool for writing and running interactive code.
- Libraries:
  - numpy (for mathematical computations and data manipulation)
  - pandas (if needed, for tabular data handling)
  - matplotlib or seaborn (for any visualizations or data analysis)
